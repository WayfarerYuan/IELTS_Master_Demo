In modern times, the amount of companies hold business meeting or training online have been rapidly increased. I believe the benefit of this change outweigh its drawbacks.
The application of online conference room break down the geographic barriers which can help improve the efficiency of meeting and training, as well enlarge the range of companies and employees to connect with. Firstly, have a meeting or training on the internet can eliminate the time spent on transportation. People can get into work at any places quickly and put more effort on preparing for the meeting of training. Secondly, the cross-regional meeting or trains allows people from different cities or even countries to join in, which can enrich the  opportunity of commerce as well as entrance to new industries and may lead to more profit. 
The popularization of online conference and training also help companies to cut down their cost. It is clear that there is no need for people to spend money on arranging the place for conference or training and the preparation for paper data or even meals. Whatâ€™s more, the transportation fees can also be omitted. Another change which can reduce the budget is the eliminate of repeated work. For instance, a big company which have various sectors or branches in difference area can train their employees at one time online, rather than separately. In this way, companies can save a lot of manpower and financial resources.
In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I believe that the advantages of online meeting and training outweigh the disadvantages.
